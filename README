spo2cms50d+ - Downloads recorded data from a CMS50D+ Pulse Oximeter (firmware version 4.6)

A Python script that downloads recorded data from CMS50D+ Pulse Oximeters and stores it in SpO2 format.
This script is only tested together with a CMS50D+ with firmware version 4.6.

There is a reason to believe that CMS50D+ with firmware version 4.6 differs in serial communication compared to older versions, as other applications seems to use other parameters and values when communicating.

Usage:
1. Plug in the USB cable
2. Start the CMS50D+ (mine says Ver4.6)
3. Press and hold the button to enter the menu
4. Don't press anything else, leave it in the menu (this way the device will not shut down automatically)
5. Run this spo2cms50d+ script (see example given below)
6. Exit the menu on the CMS50D+

Example:
./spo2cms50d+ /dev/ttyUSB0 ~/my_cms50dplus_file.SpO2


It is also possible to set the start time.
Run "./spo2cms50d+ --help" for more details.
